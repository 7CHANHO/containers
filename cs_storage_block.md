# Storing data on IBM Block Storage for IBM Cloud


## Installing the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in in your cluster
{: #install_block}

Install the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in with a Helm chart to set up pre-defined storage classes for block storage. You can use these storage classes to create a PVC to provision block storage for your apps.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin, [target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster where you want to install the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in.

1. Install [Helm](cs_integrations.html#helm) on the cluster where you want to use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in.
2. Update the helm repo to retrieve the latest version of all helm charts in this repo.
   ```
   helm repo update
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Install the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in. When you install the plug-in, pre-defined block storage classes are added to your cluster.
   ```
   helm install ibm/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```
   {: screen}

4. Verify that the installation was successful.
   ```
   kubectl get pod -n kube-system | grep block
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   ibmcloud-block-storage-driver-kh4mt                              1/1       Running   0          27d       10.118.98.19   10.118.98.19
   ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin-58c5f9dc86-pbl4t                   1/1       Running   0          14d       172.21.0.204   10.118.98.19
   ```
   {: screen}

   The installation is successful when you see one `ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin` pod and one or more `ibmcloud-block-storage-driver` pods. The number of `ibmcloud-block-storage-driver` pods equals the number of worker nodes in your cluster. All pods must be in a **Running** state.

5. Verify that the storage classes for block storage were added to your cluster.
   ```
   kubectl get storageclasses | grep block
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   ibmc-block-bronze            ibm.io/ibmc-block
   ibmc-block-custom            ibm.io/ibmc-block
   ibmc-block-gold              ibm.io/ibmc-block
   ibmc-block-retain-bronze     ibm.io/ibmc-block
   ibmc-block-retain-custom     ibm.io/ibmc-block
   ibmc-block-retain-gold       ibm.io/ibmc-block
   ibmc-block-retain-silver     ibm.io/ibmc-block
   ibmc-block-silver            ibm.io/ibmc-block
   ```
   {: screen}

6. Repeat these steps for every cluster where you want to provision block storage.

You can now continue to [create a PVC](#create_block) to provision block storage for your app.

<br />


### Updating the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in
You can upgrade the existing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in to the latest version.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin, [target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster.

1. Find the name of the block storage helm chart that you installed in your cluster.
   ```
   helm ls | grep ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   myhelmchart 	1       	Mon Sep 18 15:31:40 2017	DEPLOYED	ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin-0.1.0	default
   ```
   {: screen}

2. Upgrade the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in to the latest version.
   ```
   helm upgrade --force --recreate-pods <helm_chart_name>  ibm/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Optional: When you update the plug-in, the `default` storage class is unset. If you want to set the default storage class to a storage class of your choice, run the following command.
   ```
   kubectl patch storageclass <storageclass> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
   ```
   {: pre}

<br />


### Removing the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in
If you do not want to provision and use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage in your cluster, you can uninstall the helm chart.
{: shortdesc}

**Note:** Removing the plug-in does not remove existing PVCs, PVs, or data. When you remove the plug-in, all the related pods and daemon sets are removed from your cluster. You cannot provision new block storage for your cluster or use existing block storage PVCs and PVs after you remove the plug-in.

Before you begin:
- [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster. 
- Make sure that you do not have any PVCs or PVs in your cluster that use block storage.

1. Find the name of the block storage helm chart that you installed in your cluster.
   ```
   helm ls | grep ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   myhelmchart 	1       	Mon Sep 18 15:31:40 2017	DEPLOYED	ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin-0.1.0	default
   ```
   {: screen}

2. Delete the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in.
   ```
   helm delete <helm_chart_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Verify that the block storage pods are removed.
   ```
   kubectl get pod -n kube-system | grep ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin
   ```
   {: pre}
   The removal of the pods is successful if no pods are displayed in your CLI output.

4. Verify that the block storage storage classes are removed.
   ```
   kubectl get storageclasses | grep block
   ```
   {: pre}
   The removal of the storage classes is successful if no storage classes are displayed in your CLI output.

<br />



## Customizing a storage class for XFS block storage
{: #custom_storageclass}

The storage classes that are pre-defined by {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} provision block storage with an `ext4` file system by default. You can create a customized storage class to provision block storage with an `XFS` file system.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin:
- [Target the Kubernetes CLI to the cluster](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure).
- Install the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Storage plug-in for block storage](#install_block).

To create a customized storage class:
1. Create a yaml file for your customized storage class.
   ```
   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
   kind: StorageClass
   metadata:
     name: ibmc-block-custom-xfs
     labels:
       addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: Reconcile
   provisioner: ibm.io/ibmc-block
   parameters:
     type: "Performance"
     sizeIOPSRange: |-
       [20-39]Gi:[100-1000]
       [40-79]Gi:[100-2000]
       [80-99]Gi:[100-4000]
       [100-499]Gi:[100-6000]
       [500-999]Gi:[100-10000]
       [1000-1999]Gi:[100-20000]
       [2000-2999]Gi:[200-40000]
       [3000-3999]Gi:[200-48000]
       [4000-7999]Gi:[300-48000]
       [8000-9999]Gi:[500-48000]
       [10000-12000]Gi:[1000-48000]
     fsType: "xfs"
     reclaimPolicy: "Delete"
     classVersion: "2"
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   If you want to keep the data after you remove block storage from your cluster, change the `reclaimPolicy` to `Retain`.
   {: tip}

2. Create the storage class in your cluster.
   ```
   kubectl apply -f <filepath/xfs_storageclass.yaml>
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Verify that the customized storage class was created.
   ```
   kubectl get storageclasses
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Provision XFS block storage with your customized storage class.

<br />



## Adding block storage to apps
{: #create_block}

Create a persistent volume claim (PVC) to dynamically provision block storage for your cluster. Dynamic provisioning automatically creates the matching persistent volume (PV) and orders the actual storage device in your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account. 
{:shortdesc}

**Important**: Block storage comes with a `ReadWriteOnce` access mode. You can mount it to only one pod on one worker node in the cluster at a time.

Before you begin:
- If you have a firewall, [allow egress access](cs_firewall.html#pvc) for the IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) IP ranges of the locations that your clusters are in so that you can create PVCs.
- Install the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} block storage plug-in](#install_block).

To add block storage:

1.  Review the available storage classes. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} provides pre-defined storage classes for block storage that you can use to provision block storage. To change the pre-defined values, consider creating a customized storage class.
    ```
    kubectl get storageclasses | grep block
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output: 
    ```
    $ kubectl get storageclasses
    NAME                         TYPE
    ibmc-block-custom            ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-bronze            ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-gold              ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-silver            ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-retain-bronze     ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-retain-silver     ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-retain-gold       ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-retain-custom     ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ```
    {: screen}
    
    To see the details of a storage class, run `kubectl describe storageclass <storageclass_name>`.
    {: tip}

2.  Decide if you want to keep your data and the block storage after you delete the PVC.
    - If you want to keep your data, then choose a `retain` storage class. When you delete the PVC, only the PVC is deleted. The PV, the actual storage device in your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account, and your data still exist. 
    - If you want the PV, the data, and your block storage device to be deleted when you delete the PVC, choose a storage class without `retain`.

3.  Decide on the storage type that you want to provision. 
    - If you want**If you choose a bronze, silver, or gold storage class**: You get [Endurance storage ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/endurance-storage) that defines the IOPS per GB for each class. However, you can determine the total IOPS by choosing a size within the available range. You can select any whole number of gigabyte sizes within the allowed size range (such as 20 Gi, 256 Gi, 11854 Gi). For example, if you select a 1000Gi file share or block storage size in the silver storage class of 4 IOPS per GB, your volume has a total of 4000 IOPS. The more IOPS your PV has, the faster it processes input and output operations. The following table describes the IOPS per gigabyte and size range for each storage class.

    <table>
         <caption>Table of storage class size ranges and IOPS per gigabyte</caption>
         <thead>
         <th>Storage class</th>
         <th>IOPS per gigabyte</th>
         <th>Size range in gigabytes</th>
         </thead>
         <tbody>
         <tr>
         <td>Bronze (default)</td>
         <td>2 IOPS/GB</td>
         <td>20-12000 Gi</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
         <td>Silver</td>
         <td>4 IOPS/GB</td>
         <td>20-12000 Gi</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
         <td>Gold</td>
         <td>10 IOPS/GB</td>
         <td>20-4000 Gi</td>
         </tr>
         </tbody></table>

    <p>**Example command to show the details of a storage class**:</p>

    <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl describe storageclasses ibmc-file-silver</code></pre>

4.  **If you choose the custom storage class**: You get [Performance storage ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/performance-storage) and have more control over choosing the combination of IOPS and size. For example, if you select a size of 40Gi for your PVC, you can choose IOPS that is a multiple of 100 that is in the range of 100 - 2000 IOPS. The IOPS that you choose is static and does not scale with the size of the storage. If you choose 40Gi with 100 IOPS, your total IOPS remains 100. The following table shows you what range of IOPS you can choose depending on the size that you select.

    <table>
         <caption>Table of custom storage class size ranges and IOPS</caption>
         <thead>
         <th>Size range in gigabytes</th>

    <p>**Example command to show the details for a custom storage class**:</p>

    <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl describe storageclasses ibmc-file-retain-custom</code></pre>

5.  Decide if you want to be billed on an hourly or monthly basis. By default, you are billed monthly.

6.  Create a configuration file to define your PVC and save the configuration as a `.yaml` file.

    -  **Example for bronze, silver, gold storage classes**:
       The following `.yaml` file creates a claim that is named `mypvc` of the `"ibmc-file-silver"` storage class, billed `"hourly"`, with a gigabyte size of `24Gi`. If you want to create a PVC to mount block storage to your cluster, make sure to enter `ReadWriteOnce` in the `accessModes` section.

       ```
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
       metadata:
         name: mypvc
         annotations:
           volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: "ibmc-file-silver"
         labels:
           billingType: "hourly"
       spec:
         accessModes:
           - ReadWriteMany
         resources:
           requests:
             storage: 24Gi
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    -  **Example for custom storage classes**:
       The following `.yaml` file creates a claim that is named `mypvc` of the storage class `ibmc-file-retain-custom`, billed at the default of `"monthly"`, with a gigabyte size of `45Gi` and IOPS of `"300"`. If you want to create a PVC to mount block storage to your cluster, make sure to enter `ReadWriteOnce` in the `accessModes` section.

       ```
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
       metadata:
         name: mypvc
         annotations:
           volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: "ibmc-file-retain-custom"
         labels:
           billingType: "monthly"
       spec:
         accessModes:
           - ReadWriteMany
         resources:
           requests:
             storage: 45Gi

    If you want to use a customized storage class, create your PVC with the corresponding storage class name, a valid IOPS and size.   
    {: tip}

7.  Create the PVC.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f mypvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

8.  Verify that your PVC is created and bound to the PV. This process can take a few minutes.

    ```
    kubectl describe pvc mypvc
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```

10.  Create the deployment and mount the PVC.
     ```
     kubectl apply -f <local_yaml_path>

11.  Verify that the volume is successfully mounted.

     ```
     kubectl describe deployment <deployment_name>
     ```
     {: pre}

     The mount point is in the **Volume Mounts** field and the volume is in the **Volumes** field.

## What needs a new home

The NFS file storage and block storage that backs the PV is clustered by IBM in order to provide high availability for your data. The storage classes describe the types of storage offerings available and define aspects such as the data retention policy, size in gigabytes, and IOPS when you create your PV.


    **Tip:** If you want to change the default storage class, run `kubectl patch storageclass <storageclass> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'` and replace `<storageclass>` with the name of the storage class.
